A small, simple, hand-drawn style Pokéball sketch with clean, thin lines and a slightly rough pencil or pen texture. The design should be minimalistic and cute, featuring soft pastel colors—light pinks, blues, and creams—with gentle shading. The Pokéball should be symmetrical and easily recognizable, on a transparent or very light background. The style should feel delicate and whimsical, suitable for a seamless tiled pattern as a subtle webpage background.
